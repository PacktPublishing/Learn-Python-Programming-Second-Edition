## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

**Setup**


Create a virtual environment with a Python version 3.7.*.


**Installing requirements**

Install all the requirements text files via pip like this:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements for the data science chapter can be cumbersome to install
so I kept them separated, in the `requirements.data.science.txt` file.

If you wish to install all requirements at once, just execute the following:

    $ pip install -r all.txt


**Updating requirements**

To update requirements you can use `pip-tools` to compile the `*.in`
sources in the `requirements` folder.

To compile and update a single `.in` file, run the following:

    $ pip-compile -U requirements.in

If you want to compile all requirements into one single `.txt` file,
run the following:

    $ pip-compile -U -o all.txt *.in

This will read all the `.in` files and compile them together into the
`all.txt` file.

The sample code will look like the following:
```
# we define a function, called local
def local():
    m = 7
    print(m)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Learn Python Programming is for individuals with relatively little experience in coding or Python. It's also ideal for aspiring programmers who need to write scripts or programs to accomplish tasks. The book takes you all the way to creating a full-fledged application.
